Final-project/Cheeta:
Creating, minting, burning our own created coin on ethereum using solidity.

Project Description:
In this project we have used basic functions and variable that have thought throughout the different modules using solidity.The main goal of this project is to create our token on ethereum blockchain.And learn basic functions such as minting and burning the tokens and also writing conditional statements to reduce basic errors.

Executing program:
To run this program, we can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, let's go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once we are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). After writing the code according to the instructions we can test the code! Now use the left tab showing "deploy", with mint we can add some coins and check the total supply and balances.

My Experience:

I really had fun coding using solidity,this concept was very foreign to me ,i think i understood the concept and language very well. i am looking forward to complete more modules and courses in MetaCrafters.
