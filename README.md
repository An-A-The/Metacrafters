The Solidity program is a simple "Hello World" program that illustrates the basic syntax and functionality of Solidity. It is a contract written in Solidity and can be used to develop smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

To execute this program, we can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps to get started:

Go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
On the left-hand sidebar, click on the "+" icon to create a new file. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol).


pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

contract HelloWorld {
    function sayHello() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
}


Switch to the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" or another compatible version.
Click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button to compile the code.
Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by following these steps:

Switch to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
From the dropdown menu, select the "HelloWorld" contract.
Click on the "Deploy" button to deploy the contract.
After the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the sayHello function. Here's how you can do that:

Click on the "HelloWorld" contract in the left-hand sidebar.
Click on the "sayHello" function.
Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and retrieve the "Hello World!" message.
This program serves as an introduction to Solidity programming and can be used as a starting point for more complex projects in the future. Let me know if you have any more questions!
