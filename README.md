Please note that the content within each section should be expanded upon to provide detailed information and instructions.
Copy and paste the following code into the file:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity 0.8.18;

contract MyToken {

// public variables here
string public tokenname = "BETA";
string public tokenabbrv = "BTA";
uint public totalsupply = 0;

// mapping variable here
mapping(address => uint) public balances;

// mint function
function mint (address _address, uint _value) public {
    totalsupply += _value;
    balances[_address] += _value;
}

// burn function
function burn (address _address, uint _value) public {
    if (balances[_address] >= _value) {
    totalsupply -= _value;
    balances[_address] -= _value;
    }
}
}


To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint and burn functions. Click on the "MyToken" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and click on the tokenname,tokenabbrv,totelsupply , and then click on the "mint" function. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and you can mint some coins. And similarly click on the "burn " function to remove some coins.
